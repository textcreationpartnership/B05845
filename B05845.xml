            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A LETTER To a Gentleman in the COUNTREY, Giving an Account of the Two Inſurance-Offices; THE <hi>Fire-Office</hi> &amp; <hi>Friendly-Society.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have received yours of the 26th of <hi>January,</hi> being an Account of the <hi>Two Inſurance Offices,</hi> the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> and the <hi>Friendly Society;</hi> and, according to your deſire, return you this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Wherein to obſerve your Own Method, I ſhall conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Securities of each Office.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Charge of Inſuring.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And in Comparing them one with another, the Arguments I uſe, ſhall ariſe from thoſe you make in your Letter to me, and the <hi>Inſurers</hi> of the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> have formerly made in their Papers directed to the City.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Inſurers</hi> of the <hi>Fire Office</hi> have, as you ſay, ſetled in Ground Rents to the value of <hi>Fifty thouſand Pounds,</hi> (which admitted) tho I fear Rents of 2100 <hi>l.</hi>
               <hi>per Annum,</hi> a great part of them lying in <hi>Marine Square, Well-Street,</hi> near <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> and other Places thereabouts, would hardly yield 24 years Purchace.</p>
            <p>On this Security by their Deed of Settlement, they have Liberty to <hi>Inſure</hi> 5000 <hi>Houſes,</hi> which the <hi>Inſurers</hi> themſelves (in the ſaid Printed Papers to the City) have valued at 400 <hi>l.</hi> a <hi>Houſe</hi> one with another; which doth charge their Security of 50000 <hi>l.</hi> with no leſs than <hi>Two Millions of Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you ſay when any Loſs happ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns to the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> it is Paid out of the Bank of the <hi>Office,</hi> and the Land which is the Fund is n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver the Leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed were a great Argument, if the <hi>Proemiums</hi> received by them were Paid into a Bank, and that Engaged for the Payment of their Loſs; but there is no ſuch thing, neither is any Perſonal Security given, but eſpecial Care taken that nothing in their Settlement ſhould <hi>Charge their Perſons;</hi> ſo that they may Pay, or not Pay, as they pleaſe; which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:179964:2"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Inſurers,</hi> yet in After-times 'tis not unlikely but it may ſo happen, when the whole Number is <hi>Inſured,</hi> that they may find it their Intereſt not to pay away their ready Money, but leave the Loſs to be Paid out of the Rents.</p>
            <p>But it can never be the Intereſt of the <hi>Inſurers</hi> in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> to ſtop Payment; becauſe their <hi>Office</hi> becomes thereby Immediately diſſolved, but whilſt they continue to make good Payment, the ſeveral Perſons in the <hi>Society</hi> (if Solvent) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to Pay it them again. Therefore there is no reaſon to fear a Default which muſt be ſo pernicious to them if they do not Pay, and of ſo little hazard (as you ſay) if they do.</p>
            <p>And tho from thence it be true that they are not ſo Perſonally concerned to be at the Charge to keep Men to put out the <hi>Fire,</hi> yet they are now ſetting them out, and did ſo Propoſe from the Beginning; which altho they may be Raw at the preſent, may ſoon become as well Diſciplin'd as the others.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay the <hi>Fund</hi> of the <hi>Fire Office</hi> is ſo large, <hi>That Conſidering the Houſes <hi>Inſured,</hi> are diſpers'd at ſeveral Diſtances, it is very Improbable (unleſs the whole City be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed) that any Loſs at <hi>one time</hi> ſhould exceed the</hi> Fund.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to put this on the Tryal, I will ſuppoſe that for the Future, as well as in the Three laſt Years (as you ſay) there will be <hi>Seven thouſand Pound</hi> to be Paid out of theſe Rents, to anſwer the Loſs by <hi>Fire,</hi> then at that rate, in 31 Years (for, for that time as many as pleaſed of the firſt <hi>Three thouſand,</hi> might have Secured their Houſes; as by the Table of their firſt Printed Rates appear) there will be Paid <hi>Seventy thouſand Pounds,</hi> which is <hi>Twenty thouſand Pounds</hi> more than their whole Stock amounts to tho valued at 24 years Purchace.</p>
            <p>But not to attend ſo long a Time as 31 Years for the Event of this Tryal, ſuppoſe only that when the firſt <hi>Seven thouſand Pound</hi> comes to be Paid by the Truſtees, out of the ſaid Rents, the reſt of the <hi>Five thouſand Perſons</hi> whoſe Houſes are <hi>Inſured</hi> and not Burnt, ſhould prefer their Bill in Chancery, and deſire the Court that an <hi>Injunction</hi> may be Granted, that the Ground Rents may not be Sold right out; but that they whoſe Houſes are Burnt, may be Satisfied out of the growing Rent, leſt in ſome time they ſhould be wholly left without Remedy, and ſome be Paid all, and others none at all; which, if the Court thinks fit to Grant, (as to me ſeems very Equal and Juſt) pray let us then ſee how the Caſe will ſtand, in the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> which will undoubtedly be thus,</p>
            <p>The whole Ground Rents being but 2100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> will not Anſwer the ſaid 7000 <hi>l.</hi> in leſs than Three years and a half, and then if 7000 <hi>l.</hi> more be Burnt, whilſt the firſt is receiving, the Owners of the Houſes Burnt muſt ſtay (I cannot ſay how long) for the Second Payment. But the Third or Fourth Loſs will ſcarcely be Paid (for ought that I can foreſee) in this Generation.</p>
            <p>The Security given by the Undertakers in the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> and ſettled in the Hands of the Right Honorable the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> and others, as Truſtees, amounts to the Value of 16000 <hi>l.</hi> in Land of Inheritance, Rent Charge of Inheritance, and ſome few Houſes; and they do likewiſe give their <hi>Perſonal Security</hi> for all the Money depoſited in their Hands to be Repaid after the ſeveral Terms of <hi>Inſurance</hi> Expire, which is <hi>Five Parts of Sir,</hi> of the whole Money Paid down to the <hi>Inſurers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to prove that this Security is abundantly Sufficient to Anſwer any Loſs may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably happen, I argue thus.</p>
            <p>Since the Beginning of <hi>September</hi> laſt, which was the Time they firſt Opened their <hi>Office;</hi> Suppoſe there were but a Thouſand Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> (tho there are ſome Hundreds more) which at <hi>Three hundred Pound a Houſe</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, raiſes a Stock of <hi>Four thouſand Five hundred Pounds,</hi> at thirty Shillings for every 100 <hi>l.</hi> and if the Number encreaſe at that Proportion for Three years, the Stock will be <hi>Twenty ſeven thouſand Pound,</hi> to Anſwer the Loſs of every ſingle <hi>Fire;</hi> beſides the <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Pound</hi> ſettled on the Truſtees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas</hi> the Fund in the <hi>Fire Office</hi> will not Anſwer above <hi>Five thouſand Pound</hi> for the Loſs that ſhall happen in the whole <hi>Three years,</hi> which is moſt apparent by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Calculation; Now if this be truly ſtated, (as I firmly believe it is,) I do not underſtand why you Aſſert ſo Poſitively, that their Security in the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> is better than that of the <hi>Friendly Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having done with the Validity of the Securities given in each <hi>Office</hi> let us <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:179964:2"/>ready) make my Tryal from what hath been <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and allowed in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and not by Dark, Foreign, and Unreaſonable Computations, things barely poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but never (I hope God) likely to happen.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to <hi>Inſure <hi>Three hundred Pound</hi>
               </hi> on a Brick Houſe in the <hi>Fire Office</hi> for Twenty one years, will coſt <hi>Seven Pound Ten Shillings</hi> in ready Money, the <hi>hare Intereſt</hi> of which comes to <hi>Nine Shillings</hi> per Annum.</p>
            <p>And had you <hi>Inſured <hi>Three hundred Pound</hi>
               </hi> on a Brick Houſe in the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> for Fifteen years next after the Great <hi>Fire,</hi> the whole Charge to the Loſs by <hi>Fire,</hi> and the yearly Payment to the <hi>Inſurers</hi> would have Coſt but <hi>Six Shillings</hi> per Annum, as by the following Computation (formerly inſerted in their Printed Propoſals) will moſt plainly appear. Suppoſe then the City and Liberries were <hi>Inſured</hi> by the <hi>Friendly Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties, in the ſaid Fifteen years, there were Ninety ſeven Houſes Burnt; (the ſeveral Numbers and Streets are mentioned in their Printed Papers to the City) but to avoid a Fraction in the Account, I ſuppoſe them <hi>a Hundred;</hi> which at <hi>Threee hundred Pound</hi> a Houſe, one with another, the whole loſs amounts in the Fifteen years to <hi>Thirty thouſand Pound;</hi> and Divided into Fifteen Parts, makes <hi>two thouſand Pound</hi> Loſs every year; to Anſwer which Loſs, ſuppoſe that in <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties, there were but <hi>Twenty thouſand Houſes</hi> (but there are really <hi>Twenty four Thouſand</hi>) and they all Secured at <hi>Three hundred Pound</hi> a Houſe, then muſt the <hi>Inſured</hi> Pay to Diſcharge the <hi>Thirty thouſand Pound</hi> by <hi>Two thouſand Pound per Annum,</hi> the Sum of <hi>Two Shillings per Annum,</hi> and no more.</p>
            <p>From whence you may obſerve what unreaſonable Calculations you have made, in Suppoſing a Loſs will exceed <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi> for <hi>a Hundred Pound,</hi> when in that Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, the real Loſſes did amount but to <hi>Eight Pence per Annum</hi> for <hi>a Hundred Pound,</hi> which I hope will caſe you of the Fears, you have, that many will leave the <hi>Society</hi> on that account.</p>
            <p>But admitting the Loſs of the ſaid Fifteen years had amounted to <hi>Seventy five Thouſand Pound,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Thirty thouſand Pound,</hi> it had yet kept within the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Money paid in the <hi>Fire Office <hi>(viz.) Nine Shillings per Annum;</hi>
               </hi> becauſe if <hi>Two Shillings per Annum</hi> Paid for <hi>Thirty thouſand Pound</hi> Loſs, then <hi>Five Shillings per Annum</hi> (which with the <hi>Four Shillings</hi> to the <hi>Office,</hi> makes <hi>Nine Shillings per Annum,</hi> the Intereſt of the Money Paid to the <hi>Fire Office</hi>) will Pay for <hi>Seventy five Thouſand Pound</hi> Loſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas that you may object that the <hi>Friendly Society <hi>Inſure</hi>
               </hi> but for Seven years, and you for Twenty One, that makes no Difference in the Charge, becauſe in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> a Houſe of <hi>Three hundred Pound</hi> may be <hi>Inſured</hi> for the ſame Money <hi>(viz.) Four Shillings per Annum</hi> as long as you pleaſe; but in the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> when the Twenty One years are expired, they muſt Pay <hi>Seven Pound Ten Shillings</hi> more, and then inſtead of <hi>Four Shillings</hi> a year Paid to the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of their Money will amount to <hi>Eighteen Shillings per Annum</hi> and <hi>Fifteen Pounds</hi> beſides out of the Purſe to the <hi>Inſurers</hi> own Uſe.</p>
            <p>By this time (I hope) you are Convinced that the <hi>Fund</hi> in the <hi>Fire Office</hi> is neither Greater, nor the <hi>Inſurance</hi> Cheaper than in the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> which hath been made plain to you, not barely by Gueſs and Imagination, but by <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There reſts only, that I ſhould clear ſome Things unjuſtly laid to the Charge of the <hi>Inſurers</hi> in the <hi>Friendly Society, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </hi> That the <hi>Sixteen Thouſand Pound</hi> Security in Land, is not Security for the Loſſes, but only for the Inſolvent. To which I anſwer, that (admit it were ſo) If the Solvent Pay for themſelves, and the <hi>Inſurers</hi> Pay for the Inſolvent: pray where is the Loſs, or what's the Inconveniency?</p>
            <p>But I wonder in Reading the Settlements of the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> you ſhould overlook the moſt Material Articles in it: where it is carefully Provided, That if the Money <hi>Inſured</hi> on any Houſe, Burnt, Blown up, or Demoliſhed, be not paid by the <hi>Inſurers</hi> within fifty days after the Rate is Set, the Truſtees by Mortgage, or ſale of the Lands or Rents, are impowered to Pay the ſame.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe (with ſome Complements to the preſent <hi>Inſurers</hi>) you ſay they may (as ſometime the Pariſh Aſſeſſors) Rate thoſe that are Solvent, ſomething the more, to Pay for thoſe that are Inſolvent: Whereas in another Article it is provided, That the Rate ſhall be made by ſuch Perſons as the Truſtees (who are Members of the <hi>Society</hi>) ſhall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179964:3"/>appoint; who will not (I ſuppoſe) over-tax themſelves for the Advantage of the <hi>Inſurers.</hi> The like miſtake (I fear a wilful one) you make about loſing the Money Depoſited, and being Caſhiered out of the <hi>Society;</hi> as if there were no more to be done, in caſe they once omitted to Pay, what became Due to the <hi>Inſurers,</hi> but preſent Caſhiering them.</p>
            <p>It likewiſe is affirmed by you, That the Protfis of the <hi>Inſurers</hi> in the <hi>Friendly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> are greater than in the <hi>Fire Office.</hi> I cannot Imagine how you Compute it; For in the Paper directed to the City, they Eſtimate the Charge of Executing their <hi>Office</hi> at <hi>a Thouſand Pound per Annum;</hi> and it is plain that Two thouſand Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> at <hi>Three hundred Pound</hi> a Houſe, brings in to the <hi>Inſurers</hi> but <hi>Four Hundred Pound per Annum,</hi> notwithſtanding the Execution of their <hi>Office,</hi> muſt needs be more Chargeable than that of the <hi>Fire Office</hi> in getting in their Money.</p>
            <p>And to make your Letter all of a piece, you affirm, That the older the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> the better; but the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> the worſe, (whoſe contrary is true) for any one that can count his fingers, muſt know that if 300 <hi>l.</hi> is to be paid by the <hi>Society,</hi> it will be eaſier ſure to have it paid by 1000 Perſons than by 500; and every 100 <hi>l. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured</hi> adds 30 <hi>s.</hi> to their <hi>Fund,</hi> which (if occaſion requires) muſt be anſwered either by the <hi>Inſured</hi> or the <hi>Inſurers,</hi> which may ſatisfie all concerned, that beſides the great charge of their <hi>Office,</hi> they have not their ſmall <hi>Proemium</hi> of 16 <hi>d per Annum</hi> only for holding Stakes.</p>
            <p>You argue alſo, That when a Loſs happens to the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> it being paid out of the <hi>Proemiums,</hi> leſſens the Security, when any Man hath paid 10 <hi>s.</hi> or 15 <hi>s.</hi> Which is another Miſtake, for the Security is the ſame after any Payment, as it was before; but theſe things may ſerve to amuſe, tho not to convince any.</p>
            <p>As for your Diſcoveries that a Thouſand Hundred to One, makes One Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to One, and that Four times Eight makes Two and thirty, with a great deal more, I cannot tell to what purpoſe, I thank you for it; but I know not at preſent what uſe to make of it, but will remember it if Occaſion ſerve hereafter.</p>
            <p>But in the next Computation; you are very unmerciful in Seven years time to Burn a Fourth part of the Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> by them, deſtroy their little Town, blow up their <hi>Office,</hi> and diſſolve the <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince it cannot be helpt, but ſo you will have it, let me turn the Tables, and ſee if a quarter of the Houſes ſecured by the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> be Burnt in the ſame time (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Fire</hi> will not be Partial) whether Matters would be much mended.</p>
            <p>The Fourth part of the Houſes <hi>Inſured</hi> in the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> are as you confeſs, a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; to Anſwer the Loſs of which when Burnt, will require (by your own Eſtimate of <hi>Four hundred Pounds</hi> a Houſe,) <hi>Four hundred Thouſand Pound,</hi> which being taken out of <hi>Fifty thouſand Pounds</hi> (the <hi>Fund</hi> ſo magnified by you) what will remain to Anſwer the Loſſes of the Three thouſand Houſes by them <hi>Inſured,</hi> and not Burnt.</p>
            <p>Having now made it appear, (by arguments raiſed from your Letter, and their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) That no leſs than <hi>Twenty hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> will be Charged on the Fund of the <hi>Fire Office,</hi> when their 5000 Houſes are Inſured, and that no payment can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be expected from thence, but out of the growing Rent, (there being no Bank ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to make other payment as is pretended,) And that the Charge of Inſuring in the <hi>Friendly Society,</hi> had not (though the Loſs had been more than Double in the 15 Years before mentioned) exceeded the <hi>Bare Intereſt</hi> of the Money given to the <hi>Fire Office.</hi> And that it cannot be the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Inſurers in the <hi>Friendly Society</hi> to ſtop payment; but may be of the <hi>Fire Office.</hi> I may now with great Reaſon reſolve to Inſure my Houſes with the <hi>Friendly Society;</hi> and the rather, becauſe Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Dolben,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trinder,</hi> who Drew and Peruſed their Settlement, bedfie a great Number of Eminent Lawyers and Perſons of Honour and Quality, have already made themſelves Members of the ſaid <hi>Society.</hi>
